-- Ex. 6 Newtonâ€™s method for computing the square root of a (non-negative) floating-point
-- number n can be expressed as follows:
--
--  * start with an initial approximation to the result;
--  * given the current approximation a , the next approximation is defined by the
--    function next a = (a + n/a) / 2 ;
--  * repeat the second step until the two most recent approximations are within some
--    desired distance of one another, at which point the most recent value is returned as
--    the result.
